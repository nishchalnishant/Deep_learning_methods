# Terms related to the SVM algorithm

- Kernel - helps us find a hyperplane in the higher dimensional space without increasing the computational cost. Usually, the computational cost will increase if the dimension of the data increases. This increase in dimension is required when we are unable to find a separating hyperplane in a given dimension and are required to move in a higher dimension.

- Hyperplane: This is basically a separating line between two data classes in SVM. But in Support Vector Regression, this is the line that will be used to predict the continuous output.

- Decision Boundary: A decision boundary can be thought of as a demarcation line (for simplification) on one side of which lie positive examples and on the other side lie the negative examples. On this very line, the examples may be classified as either positive or negative. This same concept of SVM will be applied in Support Vector Regression as well

**Pros:**

- Works really well on high dimensional data.
- Memory efficient.
- Effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

**Cons:**

- Not suitable for large datasets.
- Doesnâ€™t work well when the dataset has noise, i.e., the target classes are overlapping.
- Slow to train.
- No probabilistic explanation for classification.
