Metrics that can be used for regression techniques --

**mean absolute error (MAE)**

- sum of all errors and divide them by a total number of observations.
- 1/n\*(sum of (y-y_hat))

**mean squared error (MSE)**

- Sum of all errors squared and dividing them by total number of observations.
- 1/n\*(y-y_hat)^2

**Root mean squared error (RMSE)**

- Square root of mean squared error
- sqrt(1/n\*(y-y_hat)^2)

**R squared**

- 1-(SSr/SSm)
- Squared sum error of regression line
- Squared sum error of mean line

**Adjusted R squares**
