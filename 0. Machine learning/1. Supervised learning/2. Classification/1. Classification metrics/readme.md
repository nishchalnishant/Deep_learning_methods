Metrics that can be used for classification techniques --

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 score

Confusion matrix
ROC curve -

- probability curve b/w true posetive rate and false posetive rate.
- seperates signal from noise.

Area under curve -

- measures the ability of a classifier to distinguish between clases .
- greater the area under curve the better is the performance of the model at different threshold points between posetive and negative classes .
- log loss / logistic loss or cross entropy loss
