**Pros:**

- Gives high performance when the conditional independence assumption is satisfied.
- Easy to implement because only probabilities need to be calculated.
- Works well with high-dimensional data, such as text.
- Fast for real-time predictions.

**Cons:**

- If conditional independence does not hold, then is performs poorly.
- Has the problem of Numerical Stability or Numerical Underflow because of the multiplication of several small digits.
