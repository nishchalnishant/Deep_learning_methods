**Pros**

- Easy to interpret
- Handles both categorical and continuous data well.
- Works well on a large dataset.
- Not sensitive to outliers.
- Non-parametric in nature.

**Cons**

- These are prone to overfitting.
- It can be quite large, thus making pruning necessary.
- It canâ€™t guarantee optimal trees.
- It gives low prediction accuracy for a dataset as compared to other machine learning algorithms.
- Calculations can become complex when there are many class variables.
- High Variance(Model is going to change quickly with a change in training data)
