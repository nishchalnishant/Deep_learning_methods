Metrics that can be used for classification techniques --

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 score
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve -
  probability curve b/w true posetive rate and false posetive rate.
  seperates signal from noise.
- Area under curve -
  measurs the ability of a classifier to distinguish between clases .
  greater the accurac
- log loss / logistic loss or cross entropy loss
