These techniques are used in cases when we have training data as well as the labels associated with them.
Based on types of prediction it can be divided in to

# Regression

We are trying to predict a number .

Metrics that can be used for regression techniques --

- mean absolute error (MAE)
- mean squared error (MSE)
- Root mean squared error (RMSE)
- R squared
- Adjusted R squares

Algorithms for regression --

- Linear regression
- Support vector machines
- Descision tree
- Random forest

# Classification

We are trying to predict a class

Metrics that can be used for classification techniques --

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 score
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- log loss / logistic loss or cross entropy loss

Algorithms for classification

- Logistic regression
- Random forest
- Naive bayes
- Support vector machines
- Descision tree
- Gradient boosted tree
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost
