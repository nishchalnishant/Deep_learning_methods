These techniques are used in cases when we have training data as well as the labels associated with them.
Based on types of prediction it can be divided in to.

# Supervised learning applications --

- predictive analysis based on regression or categorical classification
- spam detection
- pattern detection
- Natural language processing
- Sentiment analysis
- Automatic image classification
- Automatic sequence processing

# Regression

**_We are trying to predict a number_**

**Algorithms for regression**--

- Linear regression
- Support vector machines
- Descision tree
- Random forest

**Metrics that can be used for regression techniques** --

- mean absolute error (MAE)
- mean squared error (MSE)
- Root mean squared error (RMSE)
- R squared
- Adjusted R squares

# Classification

**We are trying to predict a class**

**Algorithms for classification**

- Logistic regression
- Random forest
- Naive bayes
- Support vector machines
- Descision tree
- Gradient boosted tree
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

**Metrics that can be used for classification techniques** --

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 score
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- log loss / logistic loss or cross entropy loss
