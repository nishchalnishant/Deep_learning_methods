These techniques are used in cases when we have training data as well as the labels associated with them.
Based on types of prediction it can be divided in to.

# Supervised learning applications --

- Predictive analysis based on regression or categorical classification
- spam detection
- pattern detection
- Natural language processing
- Sentiment analysis
- Automatic image classification
- Automatic sequence processing

# Regression - We are trying to predict a number

**_Algorithms for regression_**

- Linear regression
- Support vector machines
- Descision tree
- Random forest

**_Metrics that can be used for regression techniques_**

- mean absolute error (MAE)
- mean squared error (MSE)
- Root mean squared error (RMSE)
- R squared
- Adjusted R squares

# Classification -- We are trying to predict a class

**_Algorithms for classification_**

- Logistic regression
- Random forest
- Naive bayes
- Support vector machines
- Descision tree
- Gradient boosted tree
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

**_Metrics that can be used for classification techniques_**

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 score
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- log loss / logistic loss or cross entropy loss
