## Unsupervised learning

- unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised using training dataset.
- Instead, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data.
- The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the underlying structure of dataset, group that data according to similarities, and represent that dataset in a compressed format.

# Below is the list of some popular unsupervised learning algorithms:

**clustering**

- It mainly deals with finding a structure or pattern in a collection of uncategorized data.
- Unsupervised Learning Clustering algorithms will process your data and find natural clusters(groups) if they exist in the data.

**KNN (k-nearest neighbors)**

- K- nearest neighbour is the simplest of all machine learning classifiers.
- It differs from other machine learning techniques, in that it doesnâ€™t produce a model. It is a simple algorithm which stores all available cases and classifies new instances based on a similarity measure.
- It works very well when there is a distance between examples.
- The learning speed is slow when the training set is large, and the distance calculation is nontrivial.

**Principal Components Analysis**

- In case you want a higher-dimensional space. You need to select a basis for that space and only the 200 most important scores of that basis.
- This base is known as a principal component. The subset you select constitute is a new space which is small in size compared to original space.
- It maintains as much of the complexity of data as possible.

- **Advantages of Unsupervised Learning**

- Unsupervised learning is used for more complex tasks as compared to supervised learning because, in unsupervised learning, we don't have labeled input data.
- Unsupervised learning is preferable as it is easy to get unlabeled data in comparison to labeled data.

**Disadvantages of Unsupervised Learning**

- Unsupervised learning is intrinsically more difficult than supervised learning as it does not have corresponding output.
- The result of the unsupervised learning algorithm might be less accurate as input data is not labeled, and algorithms do not know the exact output in advance.
