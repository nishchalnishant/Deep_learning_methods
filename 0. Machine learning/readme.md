# Statistical concepts

- Measures of central tendency
- Hypothesis testing

# Supervised learning - Learning where we have data as well as labels corresponding to them

- Regresssion - trying to predict a number
- Classification - trying to predict a class

# Unsupervised learning

- Clusturing - dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups
- Dimensionality Reduction - techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset
