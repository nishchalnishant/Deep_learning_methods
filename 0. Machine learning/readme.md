- This sub part of the repository contains the traditional machine learning methods ranging from regression techniques such as linear regression to dimensionality reduction techniques such as LDA, PCA ext.

- learning
  majority of the algorithms try to find th ebest seperating hyperplane by imposing different conditions , however the goal is slways the same , reducing the number of missclassification and increasing the noise robustness.

# Supervised learning - Learning where we have data as well as labels corresponding to them

- Regresssion - trying to predict a number
- Classification - trying to predict a class

# Unsupervised learning - Learning where we only have the data.

- Clusturing - dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups
- Dimensionality Reduction - techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset
