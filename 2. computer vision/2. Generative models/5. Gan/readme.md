> Generative adversial network

GAN takes a supervised learning approach to do unsupervised learning by generating fake or synthetic looking data.

Essence of GAN can be summated as training of two networks simultaneously called the generator network denoted by G and the
discriminator network indicated by D.

D is a binary classifier learns to classify the real and generated data
as genuinely as possible.

In contrast, G confuses D by generating realistic data
